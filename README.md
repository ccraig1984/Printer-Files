3D printer FFF files to Import or to Export
This is for everyone. 
I don't believe that knowledge should be hidden.
These are just some FFF for S3D and anything I want to store between the different computers that I use.
Anyone can use these and I will update them as often as I can and will def be open to people adding their input to this Repository.
If you have any questions or comments feel free to email me @ ccraig1984@gmail.com or through here!
If you want to add a file I can put the file up here for you so you can pull it at anytime.
I have two printers at the moment one of them is an Anet A8 that has been modified to have a metal frame of 20x40 extrusions and also an upgraded board. I have a bowden setup and also a few other odds and ends that will eventuall get mentioned. 
My second printer is a CTC 3D dual extrusion that once again has been modified. I am running a marlin board with the same PSU and steppers. Some of the other upgrades are not nearly as elegant but it gets the job done for ABS prints. 
Thank You!!!!
Keep on Printing!!!!
